Please read the instructions and questions *carefully*. This is an open-book assignment, so feel free to use your highly honed Google-Fu skills, but please don't copy the work of others or have anyone else help you. The entire team will evaluate your homework, which means you are free to use acronyms and technical/industry-specific language where appropriate and expedient.

      2. Development

      5. Operations
   2. Each network segment should be able to use a single organizational file server.
   3. Each business group should be able to traverse the network to all other business groups except for Sales and Marketing; they should only be able to access their own network.

### For the following, please submit the respective XML files in the same .zip archive used for the scripting exercises at the end of this assessment.

1. In PDQ Inventory, create a registry scanner that checks for the default RDP port. Create two collections based on the results: one collection for machines with the default port and one collection for machines not using the default port. Please include the XML files for the scanner and both collections.

2. Using PDQ Deploy, create a package to deploy Office 365. Please include any config files you would use and the XML of the package.

### Scripting exercise:
Write a script (PowerShell preferred, but certainly not required) that does the following: 
* Find all json files located within each user's `%AppData%` directory.
* Output to the console in the following format: `.json files found in`

## Final Step:
When finished, zip up the following into one archive, ensuring the single .zip file contains your name:
- [x] The plain .txt file containing the questions and answers to the first 15 questions
- [x] The XML files from the seven PDQ Inventory and PDQ Deploy questions. The XML files should be tied logically to their respective exercises. How you decide to do that is part of the assessment.
- [x] The script from the scripting exercise

Once you have completed the above, upload the .zip file to https://link.pdq.com/application (no account required). Submissions are reviewed within 3 - 6 business days by the entire team and considered for an interview.

## :warning: Important
*Do not include anything in your homework submission (other than your name as the zip file) that could identify you. Submissions are anonymized on receipt so our team does not know whose homework they are evaluating.*
